# /r/buildapcsales bot

A subreddit link scraper that helped me successfully acquire PC parts from January-March 2021. This was my first Python project

## Description

Developed using the "praw" library that works with the Reddit API. Instantiated within a dedicated channel in my personal discord server.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.6+
* praw, asyncio, discord
* Refer to the requirements.txt for any required libraries

### Installing

* Create a pull request or download this depository directly
* It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies in the requirements.txt file

### Executing program

* To run from Python, first you must enter your own credentials within the "reddit" variable name
* In order for this bot to run as intended, it must be left running on a dedicated machine
